# 📂 Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of small-to-medium Python projects built as part of continuous learning and practical experimentation. Each folder represents a standalone project focused on a specific concept such as APIs, automation, email handling, or data processing.

The projects are intentionally modular and beginner-to-intermediate friendly, with an emphasis on **clean Python**, **real-world use cases**, and **hands-on practice**.

## 📁 Project Overview

### 1️⃣ `api_endpoints`

**Focus:** API fundamentals and endpoint handling

This project explores how to create, structure, and consume API endpoints using Python. It is designed to strengthen understanding of:

* RESTful API concepts
* Request/response cycles
* JSON handling
* Route definitions and parameter passing

**Key Concepts:**

* HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.)
* Endpoint design
* API testing and debugging

---

### 2️⃣ `quizzler-app-start`
**Focus:** Application logic and user interaction
This is a quiz-based application that demonstrates how to structure application logic, manage state, and interact with user inputs. It is often used as a stepping stone toward GUI or API-driven applications.

**Key Concepts:**
* Object-oriented programming (OOP)
* Data structures
* Game / quiz logic
* Incremental feature building

---

### 3️⃣ `smtp_mailer`
**Focus:** Email automation using SMTP
This project demonstrates how to send emails programmatically using Python’s SMTP libraries. It is useful for automation tasks such as notifications, alerts, and scheduled messages.

**Key Concepts:**
* SMTP protocol
* Secure email authentication
* Environment variables for credentials
* Error handling for email delivery

**Typical Use Cases:**
* Automated emails
* Notifications
* Simple mailing scripts

---

### 4️⃣ `stock_news_api`
**Focus:** External API integration & automation
This project integrates stock market data with news APIs to fetch real-time or recent information about companies. It showcases how multiple APIs can be combined to build meaningful automation workflows.

**Key Concepts:**
* Third-party API integration
* API keys & environment variables
* Data filtering and formatting
* Conditional logic based on data changes

**Typical Use Cases:**
* Stock alerts
* Market monitoring
* Data-driven notifications

---

### 5️⃣ `weather_api`
**Focus:** Consuming public APIs and data parsing
This project fetches and processes weather data from an external API. It reinforces the fundamentals of making API requests and handling structured responses.

**Key Concepts:**
* API requests using Python
* JSON parsing
* Error handling
* Data extraction and presentation

**Typical Use Cases:**
* Weather lookups
* Automation scripts
* API practice projects

---
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* Python 3
* REST APIs
* JSON
* SMTP
* Environment Variables
---

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate into any project folder
3. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
4. Install required dependencies (if applicable)
5. Configure environment variables for API keys or credentials
6. Run the main Python script

---
## 📌 Notes
* Each project is self-contained
* API keys and credentials should **never** be hard-coded
* Environment variables are recommended for sensitive data

---

## 📈 Purpose
These projects are part of an ongoing **learning-by-building** approach, aimed at strengthening Python development, automation, and API integration skills through practical examples.
Feel free to explore, extend, or refactor any project as needed.
